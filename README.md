Genetic Algorithm for Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)  

Introduction  
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Features  
Genetic Algorithm: Utilizes selection, crossover, and mutation operators to evolve solutions.  
Configurable Parameters: Allows tuning of population size, mutation rate, and number of generations.  
Visualization: Displays the best route found during the evolution process.  

Requirements
Python 3.6
